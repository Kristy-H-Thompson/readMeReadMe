## Description
Want to more time on your projects and less time writing tedious readMe files? Now you can quickly and easily generate a README file by using this command-line node.js application to generate one. This allows YOU, the project creator, to devote more time working on the project.

- What was your motivation for creating this project?
My motivation for creating this project was realizing that it takes a lot of time to create a quality ReadMe file. No matter how carefully I worked on my readMe file, I always forgot at least one important aspect that I should have included. With the prompts, this project makes creating a readMe file a breeze. 
- What problem does it solve?
 This project solves the problem of forgetting sections while creating a profesional readMe file for github projects.
- What did I learn? 
Creating this project I learned how to use Node.js to create new files in my repository. I also learned about inquirer, and how it creates prompts in the terminal. I was impressed on the documentation that inquirer had, and I was able to follow it to create this project very easily.
